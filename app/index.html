      </p>
      <p>
        The GCC has one of the fastest-growing populations in the world. By 2020, it is estimated that the Gulf will have well over 36 million consumers and an economy worth over $2 trillion. The majority of the population will be under 25 years of age, increasingly well-educated, and all of the digital age. With smartphone penetration already higher than in the USA, demand for mobile data, applications and digital services presents significant opportunities for the new generation of digital pioneers.

          The Marketing and Communication team would then review and amend the plans, again in light of the above stages and extensive local knowledge of the markets and potential customers or clients. This will ensure the smooth launch and growth of each and every JV the company enters into.
